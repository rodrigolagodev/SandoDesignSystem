<!--
  Sando Design System - Color Scheme Meta Tag
  
  This enables the browser to use the appropriate color scheme for
  native elements (scrollbars, form controls, etc.) based on 
  either system preference (auto mode) or manual selection.
  
  The token system now handles theme switching via:
  1. @media queries for automatic system preference detection
  2. [data-color-mode] selectors for manual theme switches (Storybook UI)
  
  No preload script is needed because the CSS selectors handle both cases.
