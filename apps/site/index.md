## Philosophy

Sando is inspired by the Japanese "katsu sando" sandwich. Just like a sandwich has layers that work together to create something delicious, our design system has three layers:

1. **Ingredients** - Raw, atomic values (colors, spacing, typography)
2. **Flavors** - Semantic tokens that give meaning and context
3. **Recipes** - Component-specific tokens that bring it all together

This architecture ensures consistency while allowing complete flexibility through theming.
