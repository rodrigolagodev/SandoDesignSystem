    Establish comprehensive standards for writing long-form tutorial and guide documentation in VitePress for the Sando Design System. This includes frontmatter configuration, markdown features, code examples, navigation structure, and content organization to ensure guides are clear, accessible, and maintainable.

targets:
  id: "VPG-TGT"

    - "Getting Started guides, conceptual tutorials, integration guides, accessibility guides"

scope:

  note: "Documentation review, VitePress build validation"

core_rules:
  - id: "VPG-CR-R1"
    title: "Frontmatter with Title and Description (Required for SEO)"
    summary: "Every guide page SHOULD include frontmatter with title and description for SEO and social sharing, though VitePress can generate these from content if omitted."

        # Quick Start

        Get started with Sando design tokens in your project.
    why: "Frontmatter title/description improve SEO, control browser tab text, and customize social media preview cards. VitePress uses h1 as fallback if omitted."
    note: "Frontmatter is OPTIONAL. VitePress will extract title from first h1 and description from first paragraph if frontmatter is missing. Use frontmatter when you need explicit control over SEO metadata."

        ::: danger Critical Warning
        Information about potential breaking changes or serious issues.
